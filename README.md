TopCoder API (built on NodeJS)
==============================

As [TopCoder](http://www.topcoder.com/tc) and [CloudSpokes](http://www.cloudspokes) integrate, the APIs are going to play a critical role. TopCoder has already started work on a API, which can be found [here](http://dev.topcoder.com). That API is built on a Java stack.

In order to accelerate development we are looking to move some of the API work to use a more cloud-friendly approach built on [NodeJS](http://www.nodejs.org). This is complicated by the fact that the back end of TC relies on an Informix DB.

Usage
-----

See the [Deployment Guide](https://github.com/cloudspokes/tc-api/blob/master/docs/Module%20Assembly%20-%20TopCoder%20NodeJS%20Authentication%20Middleware%20v1.0.doc) for detailed instructions. 

*Notes*: We have provided clear steps to setup in CentOS 6.x, Ubuntu and MacOS, please check [wiki](https://github.com/cloudspokes/tc-api/wiki)

Other flavors/versions of linux should work, but have not been validated yet. Windows based operating systems most likely will NOT work.
